Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
    --A data structure is a specialized format for organising and storing data. General data structure types include the array,
     the file, the record, the table, the tree, and so on. Any data structure is designed to organize data to suit a specific purpose
     so that it can be accessed and worked with in appropriate ways.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
    --Traversing, Searching, Inserting, Deleting, Sorting and Merging.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
    --Data Strucures are mostly used in Database Management System, Compiler Design, Operating System, Statistical analysis package,
     Numerical Analysis, Graphics, Artificial Intelligence and Simulation.

what is an Array?
    -Array is used to store block memory. Also we can say array is used to store a collection of data.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
    --The main difference with Array and ArrayList is, in Array the array size is static in nature. That means its length is fixed.
     we canâ€™t change its size once it is created. On the other hand ArrayList is dynamic in nature. ArrayList is also called as dynamic array or re-sizable array.
     Because, it automatically resizes itself if we try to add elements beyond its capacity. Array uses length function and arraylist uses size function.

what is LinkedList?
    -LinkedList is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
    -In array, each element is independent, no connection with previous element or with its location. In Linked list, location or address
    of elements is stored in the link part of previous element/node. In array, no pointers are used like linked list so no need of extra space in memory for pointer.

what is queue?
    --A queue is designed to have elements inserted at the end of the queue, and elements removed from the beginning of the queue. Queue follows First In First Out (FIFO) principle.

what is stack?
    --It is a data structure that allows data to be inserted and removed. Stack follows Last In First Out (LIFO) -queue. Therefore last data to be
     inserted will be the first data to be removed.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
    --FIFO: First In First Out
      LIFO: Last In First Out.

what is the order of complexity?
    --It is a certain mathematical expression of the size of the input, and the algorithm finishes between two factors of it.
     Generally, the smaller the order of complexity of the program's underlying algorithm, the faster it will run and the better it will scale as the input gets larger.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
what is tree in data structure?
what is graph in data structure?
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
How HashMap works in java?
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
What is DFS and BFS?
What is Recursion?
What are linear and non linear data Structures?
What is Big-(O)-notation?
Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
